# StateMon

Simple React-app, which lets you monitor Horizon collections in real time. Type in the collection name, and press enter, or select connect. You should see a live-updated view of the data in that collection. You can close the box with the X, or add new boxes with the + at the bottom of the screen.

If you want to open multiple collections, simply type in all the collection names, separated by commas, in a single input box. This will open one box for each collection specified.

`npm start` assumes that the horizon server is already running, use `npm run startall` to start the server, and horizon together.

Refactor into multiple files :)
