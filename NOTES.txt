Right now Rethink stuff seems to work just fine. Needs to have a running Rethink server on the standard port. 

upsert.forEach with error reporting always reports errors, but seems to work.

Need to investigate hosting on production server, CORS issues etc. There might be too many events triggered by a Redux store update, maybe ways of making it more rational.
